Step 1:
Launch two ec2 instances.

Step 2:
Go to Mobaxterm.
Declare any one of the instances as host.I declared my first instance as host.
Run the following command.
ssh-keygen –t rsa
The pub key has been saved as “id_rsa.pub” and private key saved as “id_rsa”.
Go to directory where the keys are stored.
Open the public key file.
Copy the public key.
Sve it in a temporary file.

Step 3:
Now open destination ec2 instance.
We replace public key of second instance with first one.

Step 4:
execute the following command.
ssh destination private ip adress
The destination instance is opened with its ip address displaying.


Thus we have established a passwordless ssh.
